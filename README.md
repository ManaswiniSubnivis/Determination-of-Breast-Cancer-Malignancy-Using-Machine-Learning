# Determination-of-Breast-Cancer-Malignancy-Using-Machine-Learning


-The data set can be found in UCI Machine Learning Repository:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
-The dataset has features that are computed from a digitalized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
-Attribute Information:
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
-Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
-Implemented predictive modeling techniques, including Linear Regression, KNN classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest
Classifier.
-Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices and decision trees, ensuring accurate predictions.
